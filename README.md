# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of School District Analysis: 
The purpose of this analysis was to help the School District Board uphold state testing standards for the school district, after exposure of academic dishonesty in ninth graders at Thomas High School. Math and reading scores were replaced and a re-analysis was completed looking for the following:
- High level view of the district's key metrics
- Overview of the key metrics for each school:
  - Top 5 and bottom 5 performing schools, based on the overall passing rate
  - The average math score received by students in each grade level at each school
  - The average reading score received by students in each grade level at each school
  - School performance based on the budget per student
  - School performance based on the school size 
  - School performance based on the type of school

## Results:
- How is the district summary affected? The district summary was affected very slightly in overall scores, however, not a large change to garnish any concerns.

## Summary: 
The main changes that are observed from the original data set to the reanalyzed data set was the number of ninth grade students excluded, the total number of 10th to 12th grade students for Thomas High School that were included in the data, the average scores for math and reading, and the overall passing percentages. Even with the exclusion of Thomas High School's ninth graders, there was not much differences between both data sets. The School Board will not need to make much changes when planning for future state testing standards.
